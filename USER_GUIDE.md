## Getting Started

Kiwi Meal Planner uses AI to generate personalized weekly meal plans based on your preferences, dietary restrictions, and what you have in your pantry.

### Quick Start

1. **Sign in** with Google or email to save your data across devices
2. **Configure your plan** - choose number of days, people, and which meals to include
3. **Add pantry items** - tell us what ingredients you already have
4. **Set preferences** - dietary restrictions, likes, and dislikes
5. **Generate!** - AI creates a custom meal plan with shopping list

### Account Benefits

When signed in, your data syncs across all devices:
- Saved recipes and favorites
- Pantry inventory
- Preferences and settings
- Plan history

---

## Creating a Meal Plan

### Step 1: Configure Your Plan

Choose your meal plan settings:
- **Number of days** (1-7)
- **Number of people** - affects portion sizes and shopping quantities
- **Meals to include** - Breakfast, Lunch, and/or Dinner

### Step 2: Add Pantry Items

Tell the AI what ingredients you already have:
- Type ingredient names to add them
- The AI will try to use these ingredients first
- This reduces your shopping list

### Step 3: Set Your Preferences

Be specific for better results:
- **Dietary restrictions** - e.g., "vegetarian", "gluten-free", "no nuts"
- **Likes** - e.g., "Italian food", "spicy dishes", "one-pot meals"
- **Dislikes** - e.g., "mushrooms", "seafood", "overly sweet dishes"

**Pro Tip**: Instead of vague preferences like "healthy food", try specific ones like "high protein, low carb meals with vegetables".

### Step 4: Generate

Click "Generate Meal Plan" and the AI will create:
- A complete meal plan for your selected days
- Recipes with ingredients and instructions
- A consolidated shopping list (minus pantry items)

### Rating Meals

After viewing a meal plan, rate each meal:
- **4-5 stars** - Recipe is saved to your "AI Generated" cookbook
- Lower ratings help the AI learn your preferences

---

## Use What I Have Mode

> **Pro Feature**: Use What I Have mode is available with a Pro subscription.

Maximize your pantry ingredients and minimize shopping with the smart "Use What I Have" mode.

### What is Use What I Have?

This intelligent mode tells the AI to **prioritize ingredients you already have** when generating meal plans and recipes. Instead of creating the "best" recipes and then building a shopping list, it flips the approach: build recipes around what's in your kitchen first.

### Benefits

- **Reduce food waste** - Use ingredients before they expire
- **Save money** - Smaller shopping lists mean lower grocery bills
- **Less shopping trips** - Only buy what you truly need
- **Smarter meal planning** - AI considers what's available, not just what's ideal

### How to Enable It

#### From the Welcome Screen
1. If you have pantry items saved, a prominent **"Use What I Have"** button appears
2. Click it to go directly to meal plan configuration with the mode enabled
3. The button shows a ✨ Smart badge indicating AI-powered optimization

#### From Plan Configuration
1. During meal plan setup, find the **Recipe Mode** section
2. Choose between:
   - **Standard** - Best recipes, then shop for ingredients
   - **Use What I Have** - Prioritize pantry items to minimize shopping
3. Note: "Use What I Have" is only available if you have pantry items saved

#### From Single Recipe Generator
1. When generating individual recipes, toggle the **"Use What I Have"** option
2. The AI will try to incorporate your pantry ingredients into the recipe

### How It Works

When enabled, the AI receives special instructions to:
1. **Prioritize** your pantry, fridge, and freezer items as primary ingredients
2. **Build recipes around** what you have available
3. **Minimize** the shopping list by using existing ingredients creatively
4. **Only add items** to the shopping list when absolutely necessary

### Best Practices

1. **Keep your pantry updated** - Scan or add items regularly for best results
2. **Use the AI Pantry Scanner** - Quickly photograph your kitchen to keep inventory current
3. **Remove used items** - Delete ingredients after you've used them up
4. **Be thorough** - The more pantry items the AI knows about, the smarter it can plan

### Example Scenario

**Without Use What I Have:**
- AI creates a Thai curry recipe requiring lemongrass, coconut milk, fish sauce
- Shopping list includes all specialty ingredients

**With Use What I Have (and chicken, carrots, onions in pantry):**
- AI creates a chicken stir-fry using your chicken, carrots, and onions
- Shopping list only includes soy sauce and sesame oil

---

## Single Recipe Generator

Don't need a full meal plan? Generate individual recipes on demand.

### How to Use

1. From the **Home screen**, click "Generate a Recipe"
2. Or from **My Cookbook**, click "Generate" in the header
3. **Describe what you want** - e.g., "A quick weeknight pasta dish" or "Something healthy with chicken"
4. **Adjust servings** using the +/- buttons
5. Click **Generate Recipe**

### What You Get

- A complete recipe tailored to your description
- Ingredients adjusted for your serving size
- Step-by-step instructions
- Option to generate an AI image
- Nutrition information (click the Nutrition button)
- Save to your cookbook for later

### Include Sides & Dessert

Generate a complete meal experience with complementary sides and dessert:

1. **Check the "Include Sides & Dessert" box** before generating
2. AI creates:
   - **Main dish** - Your requested recipe
   - **1-2 Side dishes** - Complementary sides (salads, vegetables, starches)
   - **Dessert** - A fitting dessert to round out the meal
3. Use the **tabs** to switch between Main, Sides, and Dessert sections
4. Each component has its own ingredients and instructions
5. All items are included in the **PDF export**

### Regenerating Recipes

After generating a recipe, you can customize and regenerate it with variations:

1. Click the **"Regenerate"** button (amber color)
2. A modal opens with options:
   - **Main Dish Variation** - Describe changes to the main dish (e.g., "make it spicier", "use chicken instead")
   - **Include Side Dishes** - Toggle on/off with optional preferences (e.g., "simple salad", "roasted vegetables")
   - **Include Dessert** - Toggle on/off with optional preferences (e.g., "chocolate", "no baking required")
3. Each section has its own text box for specific variation requests
4. Click **"Regenerate"** to create a new version
5. The checkboxes remember if you had sides/dessert from the previous generation

### Tips for Better Results

- Be specific: "A creamy Italian pasta with mushrooms" works better than "pasta"
- Mention cooking style: "one-pot", "air fryer", "slow cooker"
- Include dietary needs: "vegan", "low-carb", "high-protein"
- The AI uses your saved preferences and pantry items automatically
- When regenerating, leave variation fields empty to get a fresh take while keeping the same general dish

## Pantry Staples

Track items you always keep in stock and create quick shopping lists for restocking.

### What are Staples?

Staples are pantry items that you always want to have on hand. Unlike regular pantry items that come and go, staples are essentials you want to maintain at all times - like olive oil, salt, pasta, rice, or your favorite sauces.

### Setting Up Staples

1. Go to **Pantry Settings** (during meal plan setup or in Settings)
2. You'll see two tabs: **Pantry Items** and **Staples**
3. In the Pantry Items tab, hover over any item
4. Click the **star icon** (⭐) to mark it as a staple
5. The item moves to the Staples tab

### Managing Staples

#### Viewing Staples
- Click the **Staples** tab in the pantry manager
- See all your staple items in one place
- A badge shows how many items need restocking

#### Marking Items for Restock
When you run low on a staple:
1. Go to the **Staples** tab
2. **Check the box** next to items you need to buy
3. Items marked for restock show a "Need to buy" badge
4. A red banner appears showing your shopping list summary

#### Shopping Completed
After buying your staples:
1. The red banner shows all items needing restock
2. Click the green **"Shopping Completed"** button
3. All restock checkboxes are cleared
4. Start fresh for your next shopping trip

### Removing Staples

To remove an item from staples (not delete it):
1. Go to the **Staples** tab
2. Click the **filled star icon** on the item
3. The item returns to regular pantry items

### Benefits of Staples

- **Never run out** - Track essentials separately from temporary items
- **Quick shopping lists** - Checkbox items you need with one click
- **Easy reset** - Clear your list after shopping with one button
- **Visual organization** - See regular pantry vs. always-stock items
- **Badge notifications** - Know at a glance if staples need restocking

### Best Practices

1. **Start with basics** - Mark 5-10 essential items as staples
2. **Review weekly** - Check which staples need restocking
3. **Keep it manageable** - Too many staples defeats the purpose
4. **Be specific** - "Olive Oil" is better than just "Oil"
5. **Update regularly** - Add new essentials, remove ones you no longer use

### Example Workflow

1. Mark "Olive Oil", "Pasta", "Rice", and "Garlic" as staples
2. During the week, notice you're low on olive oil and pasta
3. Check those two items in the Staples tab
4. Go shopping, buy olive oil and pasta
5. Click "Shopping Completed" to clear the list
6. Ready for next week!

### Clearing Your Pantry

Need to start fresh? Use the clear buttons at the bottom of each tab:

#### Empty My Pantry
- Removes **all regular pantry items** (non-staples)
- Useful when moving, doing a kitchen reset, or starting over
- Your staples remain untouched
- Click "Empty My Pantry" at the bottom of the Pantry Items tab

#### Empty My Staples
- Removes **all staple items**
- Your regular pantry items remain untouched
- Click "Empty My Staples" at the bottom of the Staples tab

**Warning**: Both actions require confirmation and cannot be undone. Items are permanently deleted from your account.

## Recipe Categories

Create custom categories to organize your cookbook exactly how you want.

### What are Categories?

Categories are **personal labels** you create to organize your recipes. Unlike tags (which are auto-generated by AI), categories are entirely your own - create them, name them, and assign recipes however you like.

### Creating Categories

1. **Open any recipe** from your cookbook
2. Find the **"My Categories"** section below Tags
3. Click the **+ Category** button
4. Type a category name (e.g., "Weeknight Dinners", "Kids Favorites", "Holiday Meals")
5. Press Enter or click to create and assign it

### Assigning Categories

Assign recipes to categories in two ways:

#### From Recipe View
1. Open a recipe in your cookbook
2. Click the **+ Category** button
3. **Select existing categories** by checking them
4. **Create new categories** by typing and pressing Enter
5. Changes save automatically

#### Multi-Select Dropdown
- Type to filter existing categories
- Check/uncheck to assign or remove
- Create new categories on the fly
- Categories appear as colored badges on your recipes

### Filtering by Category

1. In your cookbook, look for the **Categories:** filter row
2. Click any category badge to filter
3. Only recipes in that category are shown
4. Click again to clear the filter
5. Combine with tag and search filters

### Category Colors

Each category has a unique color badge:
- Colors are automatically assigned
- Makes it easy to spot categories at a glance
- Color-coded badges appear on recipe cards

### Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple** - Start with 3-5 categories
2. **Be specific** - "Quick Lunches" is better than "Lunch"
3. **Use consistently** - Assign categories as you save recipes
4. **Review periodically** - Remove categories you don't use

### Example Categories

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Weeknight Dinners** | Quick meals for busy evenings |
| **Meal Prep** | Recipes good for batch cooking |
| **Guest Worthy** | Impressive dishes for entertaining |
| **Kids Favorites** | Family-friendly recipes |
| **Healthy Options** | Lower calorie, nutritious meals |
| **Comfort Food** | Indulgent classics |
| **Holiday Meals** | Seasonal and celebratory dishes |

---

## Tags & Search

### Automatic Tagging
All recipes are automatically tagged by AI for easy organization:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|

### How Macros Are Used

#### In Meal Plan Generation
When generating meal plans, the AI considers your macro targets to:
- Balance daily nutrition across all meals
- Suggest recipes that fit your calorie goals
- Prioritize protein-rich options if you have higher protein targets

#### In Recipe Nutrition Info
When viewing nutrition information for any recipe:
- Your daily targets are shown alongside actual values
- Percentage of daily target is calculated for each macro
- Color-coded indicators show how the recipe fits your goals:
  - **Green**: Within optimal range
  - **Amber**: Moderate deviation
  - **Red**: Significant deviation (for limits like sugar/sodium)

#### Adjust Recipe to My Macros (Pro Feature)

For any recipe in your cookbook, you can automatically adjust it to fit your nutrition targets:

1. Open any recipe from your cookbook
2. Click the **"Fit My Macros"** button (Pro feature)
3. The AI reformulates the recipe to match your saved macro targets:
   - Adjusts portion sizes
   - Suggests ingredient substitutions
   - Modifies cooking methods if needed
4. Preview the changes before saving
5. Save as a new recipe to your cookbook

This feature works with both AI-generated recipes and your uploaded recipes, making it easy to personalize any dish.

### Best Practices

1. **Start with defaults** - The recommended values are based on general nutrition guidelines
2. **Consult a professional** - For specific dietary needs, consult a nutritionist
3. **Be realistic** - Set achievable targets you can maintain
4. **Review regularly** - Update targets as your goals change
